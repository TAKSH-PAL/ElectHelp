 Ma'am only focused on overall development of student. 
 If you have a decent CR with nice convincing ability.... Then this FEC would be fun.
 
 As I was the CR ..so... .thats how it worked for me.",I think none... You can prepare yourself by engaging in various conversation with students or with ma'am. Just by having open minded approch you can easily get A+ grade ..and if you gets lucky then no body can stop you from getting O grade.,"Classes were online. There's no exam for this FEC 13 in mid sem and end sem..so no preparation required.
 
 Ma'am would ask for a presentation in front of audience. And at last of semester Viva would take place .. which would be quite easy.. this viva could be in form of Group discussion, debate or as an interview.
 
 Sabko ache marks milte hai..
 Ek din phele chill environment rehta hai viva ke.. bss presentation ace se bana ke present karna.
 
 Class me padhai nahi... Aapka mind development hoga..by engaging you in different social and educational discussion."

 Bunks are a common occurrence and sometimes even the teacher cancels the class, due to lame reasons, I personally attended only 2 classes in the whole sem.
 Mam is quiet effective in her teaching ways and the content she covers is relevant to the exam. All of the exam material is provided at the start of the semester, and the teacher stays true to what was mentioned by her in the lecture regarding the exam.",2-3 Hours,"Only Offline classes are conducted, mam doesn't take online lectures, but the frequency of these classes is quite low. As a result, there is no significant burden on the students regarding attendance.
 The exam paper is often repeated, and answer sheets with maximum marks are readily available, so it only takes a maximum of two hours to complete the syllabus.
 In my personal experience, I scored an O in this subject. In fact, no student scored below an A, the general trend was an A+ and more than 12 students scoring an O in just my class alone. There was also another batch of students with similar results.
 
 The exam didn't cause any undue stress, as everyone was aware that the paper would be repeated. In fact, even with minimal preparation, one could still score well. Last day is more than enough or even if you start studying at 5 in the morning like me you'll end up with a 45. It is important to keep in mind that vocabulary and neatness of the answer sheet plays a crucial role in determining one's score, as the syllabus emphasizes on general moral values, so the only differentiating factor was vocab and neatness, this was told by the teacher in the class."

Interactions in class were helpful in exam, it didn't feel a subject where u had to mug up stuff and paste it down on sheet, was purely based on class interactions and hearing carefully. Grading was also good.","Mid Sem: 2 Hours, End Sem: 3-3.5 Hours","Syllabus was very easy and based more on our own experiences, even if you have'nt studied for a minute for exam then also you could manage a presentable score by thinking on the spot. Marks mil jaate hai agar thode bhi relevant points likh ke aate ho toh, not just for this but true for all FECs.
 
 Exams se phele stress nahi hota hai, believe me on this. Class me no one is forced to study, but agr kar loge toh exam time me bas 30 min ki padhai se kaam banjayega 
 
 All in all, especially for the students who will have BME in their semester, I recommend this to lower your mugging up burden."

Youtube pe videos dekh ke aaram se 2din tyaari karke kaafi accha score kia ja skta hai,"Offline classes . german hai to language to marks pure facts pe milte hain , baaki fill in the blanks type question hote hain to zyaada tension nahi hoti ."
,,40,German,9,Rajni Mam,Attendence pe koi issue nhi h. Teacher friendly h. Proxy shayad na ho pae. Bunks ke liye teacher ko pehle se hi batana pdega. Teaching skills are very good. Apne past experiences ke baare me bhi btati h.,Agar German language pehle se aate h basics tk bhi then this FEC is very scoring. Teacher achha pdati h and paper se ek raat pehle seriously 1-2 ghante bhi pd liye then +80% aaram se aa jaenge.,Kyonki yeh ek foreign language h to sirf paper se ek raat pehle pdne se tum just pass ho paoge but agar seriously padoge to achhe marks aa jaenge. Classes offline hi hoti h. Lenient checking hoti h. Agar aage higher studies krni h like m.tech ya MBA and woh bhi Europe me ya European based countries me to is language se aage kaafi scope bn jaata h. Agar German language literally pdni h then this FEC is very good.
,,40,German,7,Rajni batra,Thik hai,Ek raat,Good but not that much
,,40,German,8,Rajni Batra,"Proper attendance was taken in every class and no classes were cancelled, not even in the week prior to exams. But you probably won't be barred from exam if attendance is a bit low, as thay was the case for most of my batch but no one was withheld. Still I would advice to maintain 75%, as I personally do not know how others managed their attendance.
 Proxy is possible when attendance is written down on paper, but probably not when names are called, as she properly looks at the face of every person during roll call.
 We did not do any bunks so no idea.
 Her teaching skills are very good. She is pretty good at using real life examples and scenarios to explain, which is very necessary to learn a language. Also shares a lot of her own life stories and experiences (which she has a lot of), so class usually isn't boring",One day before exam is sufficient ONLY IF you attended classes and have proper notes,"Classes are all offline. I studied one day before exam, but I had attended all classes and had complete notes so it was not a problem. Papers are not difficult if again, you attended classes and have complete notes. Not very difficult to score high marks, and not that much stress before exam. Yes, unless you already know German (which I didn't), you will have to properly study in class. The day before the exam will be spent reading notes you made throughout the semester, and that is sufficient to score very good. You cannot start from scratch during exam days."
,,40,German,10,Rajni Batra,"No Proxy, easy bunks, teacher is good, good teaching skills","I knew German,so ek raat phele kaafi tha","Classes both offline and online. I knew German, so didn't have to study much. Paper is mostly fill in the blanks with options given. Paper had reading+writing+grammar and came from what was discussed in class. Take it if you really want to learn German, otherwise it's a time waste and you won't get any knowledge or marks ."
,,40,German,9,Rajni Batra,Attendance is important in this fec. Missing a class means missing a lot from knowledge pov. 1-2 short attendance will be taken care of by ma'am but else you'll have to attend classes. No chance of bunk. Guest teacher h so gets paid on every class and hence bunk nhi krne deti. Agar naam common h like Siddharth to 100% attendance kyunki pta hi nhi Hota kis Sid ko mark kr rhi h. Teaching skills were okayish to good.,Paper se ek raat pehle nhi hone wala. Pehle se padhna pdega say 1 our a week and we're good to go,Classes offline. Exam se ek raat pehle padh ke pass ho skte ho par grades ache nhi aenge fir. Marks mere highest the so idküôÇ. MCQ type/ fill in the blanks question the so Jo likhoge wo milega. Exam se ek din pehle 0 stress. Pehle stress Lena Hota h. Class me sunana pdta h otherwise Bahar se padho(youtube se nhi hoga)
,,40,German,5,Rajni Batra,Zero chances,4-4.30 hour,"Worst fec, attendance millti nahi hai aur class mei Kuch Samajh nahi aata teacher hamesa bore karti class mei aur ye language hai too Bina padhe too aap exam mei Kuch likh bhi nahi sakte aapke fec mei padhna padega"
,,40,German,6,Rajni batra,Kuch nahi sunti. Contact to bhool jao. Aur proxy ka koi scene nahi aur attendance thik nahi karegi chahe tum detain hi kyu na ho rhe ho,Regular class work revision needed,Ek din pehele padhke bhi pass hua ja sakta hai. Agar german seekhni hai to basics clear ho jate hai. Agar nahi seekni to faltu ka torture hai
,,45,Engineering Exploration,2,Sonal Singh,"On the stricter side. Seems calm and tolerant at the first glance but in actuality, it's not the case. Viva time pe you'll see :P

I know 'Engineering Exploration' sounds thrilling (yahi galti ki thi :v ) but don't go by the name. There's much better, easier and exciting electives for you to go for.
 Classes twice a week, tons of practicals, theory exams, projects, viva - this FEC has it all. Felt more burdened by this elective compared to the core subjects. Plus we had no mass bunks. There's viva for practicals as well as final project. The theory exam tho doesn't require a lot of preparation, a day or two is more than enough, though that's the case for even the toughest of electives.

Later few drawing exercises were introduced. But in the last week before endsem we were given a lot of sheets to make, which took a lot of time. For that I'll say make them before hand. Ask ur DOD friends or seniors for what is to be done in those sheets, they are simple to make but a lot of time and effort goes into them. For exams not much is to be done. Research on few artists on which class discussion takes place mostly their art and lifestyle is enough(actually the only syllabus for theory part).

In endsem we got 4 drawing questions which were ez, however in order to attempt full paper the thoery part was to be completed quickly as their was a lot to write."
