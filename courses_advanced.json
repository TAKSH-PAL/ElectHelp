As a result, there is no significant burden on the students regarding attendance.\n The exam paper is often repeated, and answer sheets with maximum marks are readily available, so it only takes a maximum of two hours to complete the syllabus.\n In my personal experience, I scored an O in this subject. In fact, no student scored below an A, the general trend was an A+ and more than 12 students scoring an O in just my class alone. There was also another batch of students with similar results.\n \n The exam didn't cause any undue stress, as everyone was aware that the paper would be repeated. In fact, even with minimal preparation, one could still score well. Last day is more than enough or even if you start studying at 5 in the morning like me you'll end up with a 45. It is important to keep in mind that vocabulary and neatness of the answer sheet plays a crucial role in determining one's score, as the syllabus emphasizes on general moral values, so the only differentiating factor was vocab and neatness, this was told by the teacher in the class.",

Research on few artists on which class discussion takes place mostly their art and lifestyle is enough(actually the only syllabus for theory part).
